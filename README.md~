# hello-world
My first repository on github used for ideas and a to-do list

My name is Justin. I am going into my third year of college to earn my bachelor's degree as a computer science student and am also independently studying front-end web-development. I will eventually move on to back-end web-development and build a portfolio here on github to show to potential employers and clients/customers.
